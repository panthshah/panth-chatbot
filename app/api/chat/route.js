PANTH SHAH - COMPREHENSIVE PORTFOLIO DATA:

Profile & Background: Panth Shah is an engineer-turned-product designer with a strong background in computer science and a passion for user-centric design. Originally from India, he moved to Boston in 2022 to pursue his Master's in Computer Software Engineering at Northeastern University. His journey into design began during his undergraduate years amid the COVID pandemic, when he realized how critical design is in transforming code into meaningful user experiences. He describes himself as an inquisitive and experimental designer – "a product designer who thrives on experimenting and trying new things". 

Panth's approach marries his technical foundation with creative UX problem-solving: he loves understanding users, crafting experiences for them, and iterating based on real feedback. This blend of coding knowledge and design sense gives him a unique perspective in projects, as noted by colleagues who praise his ability to integrate CS and UX thinking.

Personality & Philosophy: Colleagues and mentors describe Panth as curious, open-minded, and highly collaborative. He asks the right questions, listens actively, and is eager to learn – traits that make him an asset to any design team. Panth believes in honest, functional design and often references the idea that beauty isn't just about looks; it also improves usability. He champions designs that are visually appealing and effective, enhancing both user delight and ease of use. Panth is also a strong advocate for accessibility and inclusive design, ensuring his work can empower everyone regardless of background or ability. 

He values design thinking and often frames challenges as "How might we…?" questions to encourage innovative solutions. His working style is very collaborative – he frequently works across disciplines (design, engineering, product management) and encourages feedback loops with users and stakeholders at every stage.

Education & Experience: Panth earned his Master's degree from Northeastern University (Class of 2024) in Software Engineering. This technical education, combined with self-driven design projects, has shaped him into a well-rounded "UX engineer." He has professional experience as a Product Design Intern at FounderWay.ai (a startup accelerator platform) and as a Digital Experience Designer at Northeastern University ITS (Information Technology Services). At FounderWay, Panth focused on building a scalable design system and a new matchmaking product (FounderMatch), working closely with startup founders and engineers. At Northeastern, he worked on improving the university's digital platforms (like the Student Hub) and conducted accessibility audits to enhance inclusivity.

Design Toolkit: Panth is fluent in modern design and prototyping tools. His daily toolkit includes Figma (for interface design and prototyping), FigJam/Miro (for remote whiteboarding and collaboration), Adobe CC (Illustrator, Photoshop for visual assets), and Framer (for high-fidelity prototyping and even web development). He also has experience with developer-centric tools and practices – for instance, documenting design components for engineers, and using plugins like Stark for accessibility testing. Panth's comfort with code means he can effectively communicate with developers and even build out designs (he has built websites in Framer and has front-end coding experience). This "unicorn" ability to both design and code helps him iterate quickly and ensure the feasibility of his designs.

Values & Working Style: In teamwork, Panth emphasizes adaptability and collaboration. He often leads with a clear process but stays flexible to pivot as needed – a lesson he learned during hackathons and fast-paced projects. He values feedback highly: one of his core beliefs is to always return to the user for validation. User research and usability testing are integral to his process, not just one-time steps. Panth has a keen eye for detail (ensuring consistency in design systems, for example) but also never loses sight of the big picture – the business goals and user needs driving the project. He is known to be self-driven and proactive; for example, if he sees a UX issue in a product he loves (like Chrome's Reading List), he'll tackle a redesign as a personal project to explore improvements.

=== DETAILED CASE STUDIES ===

FOUNDERMATCH – CO-FOUNDER MATCHING PLATFORM (2024):

Project Overview: FounderMatch is an MVP product that connects startup founders with potential co-founders based on complementary skills, shared vision, and compatibility. Panth led the end-to-end design of this platform during a spring 2024 internship at FounderWay.ai, working with the company's co-founders, developers, and a PM. The idea originated from a Techstars hackathon win, after which the team continued development to launch an MVP in April 2024.

Problem Statement: "It's hard for startup founders to find the right co-founder." Many solo founders struggle to meet potential partners with the necessary skills and a shared vision for the business. Existing networks are often serendipitous and platforms like YC Matching or CoFoundersLab have limitations (e.g., search caps, static profiles). Early-stage founders lack a structured way to evaluate fit on deeper factors like work style and long-term compatibility, often relying on gut instinct which can lead to mismatches.

User Research & Insights: Panth began with user research, surveying and interviewing startup founders to understand their pain points in co-founder hunting. Key insights:
- Skill and Commitment Gaps: ~60% of founders reported difficulties finding partners with the right skill set and commitment level
- Vision Alignment: 11 out of 15 founders said finding someone who shares their long-term vision is "extremely important"
- Networking Limitations: About one-third (33%) of founders met co-founders through university alumni networks or random networking events
- Communication over Location: Clear communication was rated more critical than physical location when evaluating a co-founder

These findings highlighted that the problem is two-fold: a discovery issue (finding a person with the right skills and vision) and a compatibility issue (ensuring personalities and work styles mesh). The team framed a How Might We: "How might we develop an effective matchmaking filtering system that allows founders to easily specify and find potential co-founders with the desired skills, values, and goals?"

Team & Role: Panth was the lead UX/UI designer, responsible for user research, interaction design, and prototyping the end-to-end experience. He collaborated with two co-founders (product and business leads) and two engineers. Panth also acted as a bridge between users and the team – organizing founder interviews and translating insights into design decisions.

Design Process: 
1. Ideation & User Flows: Panth created detailed user flows mapping how a founder would use the app from start to finish, including the onboarding questions sequence and matching results screen
2. Feature Prioritization: They maintained a "parking lot" of features and prioritized what to include in the MVP versus later versions, focusing on the matching mechanism and profile setup as core
3. Wireframing & Sketches: Panth sketched multiple interfaces for key screens, including different ways to visualize match scores and profile compatibility
4. UI Design & Branding: High-fidelity design in Figma with a clean, startup-friendly interface and color-coding for match levels

Key Features Designed:
- Event-Based Matching: Attendees at entrepreneurship events could use a unique event code to quickly create profiles and get matches with others at that event
- Detailed Profile & Preferences: During onboarding, users answer targeted questions about their startup idea (industry, stage, vision) and qualities they seek in a co-founder
- Compatibility Scoring: A scoring system (High, Medium, Low) that considers skill fit, vision alignment, and personality traits
- Profile Tags & Search: Concise profile "tags" for each potential co-founder showing skills, values, and stage

Prototype & Testing: Panth built an interactive Figma prototype and conducted usability testing with startup founders from FounderWay's network. Testing provided insights like founders wanting to see more info about why someone was a good match, leading to explanations beneath match scores.

Outcome & Impact: FounderMatch launched in April 2024, onboarding 200+ users in the first month with minimal marketing. The platform was showcased at Harvard Innovation Labs (Techstars '24) demo event. Users spent an average of 5-7 minutes in onboarding and many completed profiles fully, showing engagement.

DESIGN SYSTEM AT FOUNDERWAY.AI:

Project Overview: During his 4-month internship, Panth improved FounderWay's design system, organizing scattered design assets into a coherent system and creating new components for upcoming features. He developed a scalable design system with 300+ reusable components that significantly improved consistency across the product suite.

Problem Analysis: Panth identified several critical issues:
- Lack of Documentation: No single source of truth for component usage or coding specs
- Disorganized Files: UI components scattered across multiple Figma files, some outdated
- Inconsistent Updates: Teams creating new UI elements without updating the central library
- Accessibility Gaps: Color contrast and typography not systematically enforced

Research Phase: Panth studied popular design systems like Material Design and Shopify Polaris, focusing on Figma components, documentation, style guides, and code implementation. He performed an interface inventory, cataloging every unique UI element across the app's screens, which revealed duplications and inconsistencies (5 different button styles, 3 different shades of primary color).

Design System Development:

Foundation & Tokens:
- Color Palette: Defined primary purple (#722ceb) symbolizing education and wisdom, along with secondary colors, neutrals, and feedback colors ensuring WCAG AA contrast
- Typography: Standardized on Inter font for efficiency, neutrality, and accessibility, with defined type scales and guidelines
- Spacing: Introduced 4px baseline grid for consistent padding and margins with standard spacers (4, 8, 16, 24px)
- Icons: Created unified icon library with thin outline style and active/inactive variants
- Accessibility: Used Stark plugin to test color combinations and ensure minimum 12px font sizes

Component Library: Built 300+ components and variants in Figma including:
- Basic elements: buttons, form inputs, dropdowns, checkboxes with master components and state variants
- Complex components: navigation bars, cards, modals, tables with responsive behavior
- Used auto-layout and constraints for responsive components that mirror frontend behavior
- Defined patterns like standard modal layouts (header, body text, actions) and responsive grids

Documentation: Created comprehensive guide covering:
- Component usage guidelines with do's and don'ts
- Props & variants mapping to code variables (working with frontend team for naming alignment)
- Accessibility reminders and focus states
- Structured handoff checklist for developers

Implementation & Collaboration: Panth kept developers involved throughout, even pair-reviewing implementation code to verify spacing and styles matched Figma specs. This created a smoother design-to-dev workflow where developers could refer to documentation and ask fewer questions.

Results:
- 15% decrease in design inconsistencies across the product
- Developers reported faster development times (5-day feature reduced to 3 days using reusable components)
- 2x faster prototyping for designers
- Improved user experience with more polished, cohesive feel
- Created a living system that the team could maintain after Panth's internship

ACCESSIBILITY AUDITS AT NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY:

Overview: Panth conducted accessibility audits for seven Northeastern University websites, evaluating each against WCAG 2.1 guidelines using a checklist provided by the university's digital accessibility team.

Audit Areas:
- Keyboard Navigation: Verified all interactive elements are navigable using just keyboard with visible focus indicators
- Responsive Design: Ensured content remained usable across screen sizes and zoom levels
- Headings & Page Titles: Checked heading structure for semantic accuracy and descriptive page titles
- Landmarks & Link Text: Validated semantic landmarks (<main>, <nav>, <footer>) and descriptive link labels
- Assistive Technology Support: Confirmed components had appropriate ARIA labels and names for screen readers
- Image & SVG Alternatives: Ensured images had descriptive alt text and decorative graphics were marked appropriately
- Redundant Links: Removed duplicate links and ensured screen readers ignored visual-only icons
- Patterns & Components: Reviewed modals, menus, carousels, and accordions for accessibility compliance

Tools & Methods:
- WAVE Evaluation Tool: Checked for missing labels, color contrast, and ARIA roles
- Landmark Role Guide: Verified correct use of ARIA landmarks for easier navigation
- ARIA Tab Patterns: Reviewed tab components for proper accessibility behaviors
- Accessibility Bookmarklets: Quick identification of key accessibility issues and visual indicators

Key Learnings:
- Keyboard Navigation is Critical: Many components missed keyboard accessibility, impacting users who can't use a mouse
- Clear and Descriptive Alt Text: Essential for screen reader users; missing or vague descriptions limit access to important content
- Testing with Tools Helped Identify Hidden Issues: Automated tools revealed issues missed manually, such as improper labeling or missing focus indicators

STUDENT HUB REDESIGN AT NORTHEASTERN:

Project Overview: The Student Hub is a desktop and mobile-friendly platform helping 30,000+ students navigate academic and daily life at Northeastern. Panth collaborated with product managers, digital experience lead, and UX manager on various projects, leading the redesign of the News and Events section and contributing to the "My Interest" feature.

Problem Statement: The existing "Interest" survey had poor engagement:
- 80% of students didn't fill out the survey due to no perceived benefit
- Information collected wasn't shown or used meaningfully in the platform
- Students couldn't filter or search for others based on shared interests
- Quote from user research: "I am unable to find a desired connection based on my interests, even after filing the survey form, it feels like, nothing has changed."

Goal: "How Might We make connecting with classmates based on shared interests on the Northeastern Student Hub seamless and efficient?"

Research: Through interviews with students across various majors and backgrounds, the team identified that students wanted to connect with others who share their interests, but the current system provided no visible value or connection opportunities.

Design Solution: Interest Tags System
- Added customizable interest tags to student profiles (students can select up to 6 top tags)
- Integrated tag filtering into discoverability tools
- Redesigned profile and discover sections to highlight interests
- Created tag categories spanning activities, academics, and lifestyle (e.g., "Coding," "Fitness & Wellness," "Creative Writing," "Volunteer," "Networking")

Design Process:
1. User Flow Development: Created proposed flows showing how students would add interests and discover others
2. Categorization Research: Conducted in-depth conversations with students across majors to identify most prominent and diverse interests
3. Design Iterations: Evolved from simple tag displays to comprehensive filtering and search functionality
4. System Integration: Ensured new features aligned with existing Northeastern design system

Final Implementation:
- Students can personalize profiles through interest tags displayed prominently
- Discover section allows filtering students by specific interests
- Maintained consistency with current design system while adding new functionality

Learnings:
- Learning from Diverse Collaboration: Working with a diverse team in his first US UX job showed how different viewpoints enhance creativity and innovation
- The Power of User-Centric Design: Going back to users through research, testing, and feedback sessions provided invaluable insights that drove the design process forward
